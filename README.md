Codes for Project on Probability in Speech Processing

The project aims to explore the applications of probability and random processes in the field of Speech Processing.

The project discusses the very basic concepts of random variables, probability density function, Gaussian Random variable and central limit theorem before going deeper into the topic.

Next, we dive deeper into the modelling of noise as a RV, it's filtering and the concepts of Markov Chains, Hidden Markov Models which are used excessively in the field of speech processing

The codes provided are symbolic of the process used for filtering Gaussian Noise and how Markov Models can be used to get a sentence given a set of detected words and their probabilities
